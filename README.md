# Corpus Kaamelott

## Presentation

This corpus is a collection of screenplays (400) from the French TV show [*Kaamelott*](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaamelott). The transcriptions are not official. Originally, they have been automatically scraped from a French website: [Hypnoweb](https://www.hypnoweb.net/); then, they have been normalized by automatic procedures to produce a text version.

Ultimately, *Corpus Kaamelott* intends to be an NLP-ready annotated resource, available in multiple formats.

## Distribution

At this time, only a text version is available, in the folder `txt/`. As things progress, you can evaluate the result of the most recent developments in the `sample/` folder, where a list of screenplays are gradually formatted in text mode.

## Credits

Transcribed screenplays come from [Hypnoweb.net](https://www.hypnoweb.net/).
