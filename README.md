# Corpus Kaamelott

## Presentation

This corpus is a collection of screenplays (400) from the French TV show [*Kaamelott*](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaamelott). The transcriptions are not official. They have been automatically scraped from a French website: [Hypnoweb](https://www.hypnoweb.net/).

All the selected episodes are listed in the file `static/episodes.txt`. To consult the detailed sheet of an episode, just prefix the title of an episode with this string: `https://kaamelott.hypnoweb.net/kaamelott/episode.119.2/`. Example: [https://kaamelott.hypnoweb.net/kaamelott/episode.119.2/S01E02-la-tarte-aux-myrtilles-2957.html](https://kaamelott.hypnoweb.net/kaamelott/episode.119.2/S01E02-la-tarte-aux-myrtilles-2957.html).

## Distribution

For the moment, the raw version is the only one accessible. As things progress, you can evaluate the result in the `sample` folder, where a list of screenplays are gradually formatted in text mode.
